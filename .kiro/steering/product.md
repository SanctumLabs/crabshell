# Product Overview

CrabShell is a shell implementation built in Rust. It provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface that accepts user commands and executes them.

## Core Features

- Built-in commands: `echo`, `exit`, `type`, `pwd`, `cd`
- External command execution via PATH lookup
- Command parsing with support for quoted strings and whitespace handling
- Error handling for unknown commands

## Purpose

This is a learning project demonstrating shell implementation concepts in Rust, including command parsing, process execution, and I/O handling.
