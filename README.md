This is a shell built using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)

## Pre-requisites

### [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)

Ensure you have `cargo (1.87)` installed locally to be able to install packages and manage dependencies as well as build
the application

## Running the program

Run `./your_program.sh` to run the program. This command compiles the Rust project, so it might be slow
the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
