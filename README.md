# CrabShell

This is a shell built using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)

# Pre-requisites

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.87)` installed locally
2Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles the Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
